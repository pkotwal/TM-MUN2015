		<h4 class="f-heading">MUN Society,MPSTME</h4>
		<h5 class="s-heading">The Beginning:</h5>
<p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
As an initiative taken by a group of highly motivated and promising students in the college, Model UN society came into existence in the academic session 2010-11, to provide a platform to students who are eager to broaden their mindset and develop abilities like speaking, debating and negotiating by participating in Model UN Conferences across the globe.
